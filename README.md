# 12 Days of Christmas Song - TypeScript Implementation

This project is aimed at learning TypeScript, Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Incremental Coding by implementing the 12 Days of Christmas kata.  
The 12 Days of Christmas is a classic programming problem that involves generating the verses of the traditional Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

## Problem Description

Imagine being in a music class where the teacher introduces a game called "The 12 Days of Christmas".  
The rules are simple:

- Generate the lyrics for the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
- The song has 12 verses, each verse builds on the previous one, adding a new gift each day.

## Sample Output

The lyrics are as follows:
